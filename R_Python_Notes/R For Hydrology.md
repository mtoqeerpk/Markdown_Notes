### Packages
<a id="Pack"></a>
* [ R Packages for Hydrology]( https://tonyladson.wordpress.com/2017/12/30/r-packages-for-hydrology/)
* [CRAN Task View: Hydrological Data and Modeling](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Hydrology.html) 
   - This Task View contains information about packages broadly relevant to hydrology , defined as the movement, distribution and quality of water and water resources over a broad spatial scale of landscapes. Packages are broadly grouped according to their function; however, many have functionality that spans multiple categories. We also highlight other, existing resources that have related functions - for example, statistical analysis or spatial data processing.
