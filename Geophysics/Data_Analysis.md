```
This course presents the theory and practice of GPS Geodesy with emphasis on\detecting, quantifying, and modeling deformations of Earht associated with tectonic\and geodynamic processes. The course will concentrate on GPS with introductions\to INSAR, VLBI and SLR. The relationship to traditional geodesy and surveying is\also developed. The course will cover  modeling and interpretation of the deformation data obtained.

* [CERI 7104/8104  Data Analysis in Geophysics](http://www.ceri.memphis.edu/people/egdaub/ceri7104.html)

```
This course focuses on developing computer tools useful in scientific research.<br>
Topics to be covered include: UNIX environment (Mac), Python, MATLAB,<br> Seismic Analysis Code (SAC), AWK, shell scripting, and Generic Mapping Tools .<br> 
(GMT). Learning to use computers requires extensive practice on your own - I will .<br>
try to provide many examples and problems to work on for each class, but ultimately it is up to you to figure things out. Because this course is mainly computer lab based, attendance is mandatory, and all absences must be cleared in advance with the instructor.

This course is an introductory class on how to quantitatively analyze data in the geosciences. Its purpose is to present the fundamentals of exploratory data analysis, elementary probability theory and statistics, interpolation, curve fitting, regression, time-series (spectral) analysis, and analysis of directional data (e.g., fault strikes, paleomagnetic field directions),. Examples on how to use the various techniques on real data sets (including the presence of "outliers" or bad data) will be stressed and will include both geological and geophysical examples (although we will concentrate on Geoscience applications it should be noted that these techniques are general and applicable to all the Sciences).
