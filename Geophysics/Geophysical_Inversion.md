> *     Geology surfaces folder: Geology surfaces built from drillholes
> *     Forward folder: Scripts to forward model the magnetic and gravity data from the geological surfaces
> *     L2 inversion folder: Jupyter notebooks to run Tikhonov (L2) inversions and Sparse (Lp-Lq) inversion of the gravity and magnetic data.
> *     Petrophysics folder: Jupyter notebook to build the GMM objects for all the PGI inversions.
> *     PGI individual inversion: Jupyter notebooks to perform PGI inversions of the gravity and magnetic data individually, each with the PK and HK signature respectively.
> *     PGI joint inversion: Jupyter notebook to perform the joint PGI inversion with full petrophysical knowledge
> *     PGI Joint no petrophysical means: Jupyter notebook to perform the joint PGI inversion without petrophysical knowledge
