### Role of remote sensing
<a id="Rsr"></a>

Remote sensing technique will help to locate the surfacial expressions of ore bodies, their spatial distribution and mapping of the area. It will further assist to chose and locate the test sites for preliminary survey tests. These preliminary survey will provide information concerning the local noise and site response to the particular geological and geophysical related noise information. Furthermore the rock exposures their types and structural attitude of the rock will be mapped. Terrain accessibility and knowledge is fundamental to plan and carry out the geophysical survey. The attitude and orientation of the ore body, if mappable, will greatly help to plan the survey.\

1. [Remote sensing for mineral exploration](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169136899000074)
   * Abstract
Remote sensing is the science of acquiring, processing, and interpreting images and related data, acquired from aircraft and satellites, that record the interaction between matter and electromagnetic energy. Remote sensing images are used for mineral exploration in two applications: (1) map geology and the faults and fractures that localize ore deposits; (2) recognize hydrothermally altered rocks by their spectral signatures. Landsat thematic mapper (TM) satellite images are widely used to interpret both structure and hydrothermal alteration. Digitally processed TM ratio images can identify two assemblages of hydrothermal alteration minerals; iron minerals, and clays plus alunite. In northern Chile, TM ratio images defined the prospects that are now major copper deposits at Collahuasi and Ujina. Hyperspectral imaging systems can identify individual species of iron and clay minerals, which can provide details of hydrothermal zoning. Silicification, which is an important indicator of hydrothermal alteration, is not recognizable on TM and hyperspectral images. Quartz has no diagnostic spectral features in the visible and reflected IR wavelengths recorded by these systems. Variations in silica content are recognizable in multispectral thermal IR images, which is a promising topic for research.

2. [Remote Sensing for Mineral Exploration in Central Portugal](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/7/10/184/html)
   * Abstract
    Central Portugal is well known for the existence of Sn-W and Au-Ag mineral occurrences primarily associated with hydrothermal processes. Despite the economic and strategic importance of such occurrences, the detailed geology of this particular region is poorly known and there is an obvious absence of geological mapping at an adequate scale. Remote sensing techniques were used in order to increase current geological knowledge of the Góis–Castanheira de Pêra area (600 km2) and to guide future exploration stages by targeting and prioritising potential locations. Digital image processing algorithms, such as Red, Green, Blue (RGB) colour composites, digital spatial filters, band ratios and Principal Components Analysis, were applied to Landsat 8 imagery and elevation data. Lineaments were extracted relying on geological photointerpretation criteria, allowing the identification of new geological–structural elements. Fieldwork was carried out in order to validate the remote sensing interpretations. Integration of remote sensing data with other information sources led to the definition of locations possibly suitable for hosting Sn-W and Au-Ag mineral occurrences. These areas were ranked according to their mineral potential. Targeting the most promising locations resulted in a reduction to less than 10% of the original study area (50.5 km2)

      * Abstract
      The Xiemisitai area, West Junggar, Xinjiang, China, is situated at a potential copper mineralization zone in association with small granitic intrusions. In order to identify the alteration zones and mineralization characteristics of the intrusions, Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) and Quickbird data of the study area were evaluated in mapping lithological units, small intrusions, and alteration zones. False color composites of the first principal component analyses (PCA1), PCA2, and PCA4 in red (R), green (G), and blue (B) of the ETM+ image, and relevant hue-saturation-intensity (HSI) color model transformations, were performed. This led to the identification of lithologic units and discrimination of granitic intrusions from wall-rocks. A new geological map was generated by integrating the remote sensing results with two internally published local geologic maps and field inspection data. For the selected region, false color composites from PCA and relevant HSI-transformed images of the Quickbird data delineated the details of small intrusions and identified other unknown similar intrusions nearby. Fifteen separate potash-feldspar granites and three separate hornblende biotite granites were identified using ETM+ and Quickbird data. The principal component analysis-based Crosta technique was employed to discriminate alteration minerals. Some of the mapped alteration zones using the Crosta technique agreed very well with the known copper deposits. Field verification led to the discovery of three copper mineralizations and two gold mineralizations for the first time. The results show that the PCA and HSI transformation techniques proved to be robust in processing remote sensing data with moderate to high spatial resolutions. It is concluded that the utilized methods are useful for mapping lithology and the targeting of small intrusion-type mineral resources within the sparsely vegetated regions of Northwest China

 * ABSTRACT
     The proliferation of remote sensing platforms has resulted in unprecedented opportunities for ore deposit vectoring.Importantly, remote sensing technology is now beyond the vague identification of alteration, and can accurately map specificminerals and directly contribute to the understanding of ore systems. Remote sensing is making discoveries of new alterationzones within classic and previously well mapped ore systems, as well as outlining their geometry and mineralogy. Confiningthis review to the geologically important reflected-light remote sensing systems, there are four main categories of sensors read-ily available to economic geologists, including the following: (1) submeter resolution panchromatic satellites that offer littlespectral information but provide base maps; (2) multispectral Landsat satellites that can map iron and clay alteration; (3) thenew ASTER satellite that can map important alteration groups and some specific minerals; and (4) hyperspectral airbornescanners that can provide maps of specific mineral species important to detailed alteration mapping.At the core of comprehending this plethora of technology is the difference between spectral and spatial resolution. Thisreview will provide an understanding of the more fundamental aspects of remote sensing systems that will help field geolo-gists to interact better with and leverage this rapidly evolving technology.

1. [Mineral Exploration with Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)/ Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+): A Review of the Fundamentals, Characteristics, Data Processing, and Case Studies ]( DOI:https://doi.org/10.5382/Rev.16.06)
 * Abstract
Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) has been known as the workhorse of geologic remote sensing because of its flexible spectral configuration, spanning through the visible, near-infrared, short-wave infrared, and thermal infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, coupled with adequate spatial resolutions, world-wide coverage, and easy data access. Landsat TM-type sensors have produced a considerable amount of data since 1982, allowing an impressive achievement of reliable geologic and mineral exploration results. The purpose of this paper is to review, from the mineral exploration perspective, some of the historical developments that led to Landsat TM/ETM+, the fundamentals of the sensor, its imagery, and the processing techniques that have been employed for mineral exploration applications over this nearly 25-year period, since the first TM images became available. This paper also reviews some case studies in order to demonstrate the benefits of using the existing Landsat TM/ETM+ image database for mineral exploration, particularly in the new exploration frontiers. Although the future of the Landsat program and its data-continuity policy is not clear, mineral mapping applications based on existing data will continue because of its time and/or date independency. This signifies that historical Landsat archives will continue to be employed by future generations of remote sensing exploration geologists.

### inversion 
By jointly inverting several different kinds of geophysical measurements at a site we avoid some of the ambiguity inherent in the individual methods. We show how this can be done for the combination of DC resistivity and magnetotelluric measurements on a layered medium by considering a simple 3-layer model. The combination resolves the resistivity of the thin resistive second layer, even though neither of the two methods can do so alone.


Inversion of geophysical data consists of operating directly on those data so as to generate a view of the structure which causes them. It differs from the traditional forward approach to geophysical interpretation in which a model is assumed, its response is calculated and compared with the observations, and the model parameters are then modified in a way which will hopefully improve the comparison. The virtues of inversion, if it has any, are that it uses the data to the fullest while being more economical of skilled interpreter time than is the forward approach. Consideration of the interpretation problem also suggests that it will sometimes be more cost- effective to acquire a limited number of measurements of several types than many measurements of a single type, in development and expIoration programs. 

## Joint  inversion of  RMT and TEM  data for  mapping  active  faults in northern Greece 
Joint inversion  can  increase the number  of  important  model parameters and it can  also decrease the ambiguity of  the  model  5. Hence, the joint  inversion  of  RMT  and  TEM  data will produce good resolution  of  model parameters  in  shallow  and deeper parts of  fault structure. 

Joint inversion  is  a  method for inverting  two or  more  data sets from  different geophysical  methods using  the same  model. Application  of  joint inversion  was introduced by  Vozzof  and Jupp [1975]5  and first applied by  Meju [1996]6  for Electromagnetic sounding.  

The joint inversion  of  RMT  and TEM data can  decrease  non-uniqueness  and  produce good resolution  of model parameters in  shallow  and deeper parts of  fault structure.
